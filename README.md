🌍 Why It’s Different (and Stronger Than SEO)
Traditional SEO	Fair Discovery Approach
Optimizes for algorithms (keywords, backlinks, metadata)	Optimizes for people (real user engagement)
Controlled by large search engines	Controlled by you and your users
Expensive to scale	Free and self-hosted
Ranking is opaque	Engagement data is transparent (open JSON)
Can be gamed by bots or link farms	Harder to fake — only real user interaction increases score
⚙️ How It Can “Push Your Site Ahead”

Human Validation Layer
Search engines increasingly rank based on “user signals” — bounce rate, dwell time, click depth, etc.
Your Fair Discovery data mimics that behavior and can be published openly.
→ If you share this JSON publicly (or let other sites reference it), it becomes a trust signal — a proof-of-engagement dataset.

Open Web Signals
You can make your site’s /fair-discovery/discovery.json accessible for aggregation (a community-driven “engagement index”).
That means you’re no longer waiting for Google’s crawlers — your site starts contributing to an independent discoverability network.

Organic Sharing Multiplier
High engagement correlates with real usefulness — the more people stay and interact, the more likely they’ll share your content.
The system amplifies pages that truly engage people (the opposite of keyword-stuffing).

Fairness by Design
Every site running this system has the same base algorithm:

score = time_spent + (interactions × weight)


No hidden bias, no paid boost.
It’s like an open competition for attention where quality wins.

🌍 Fair Discovery Manifesto
A Declaration for a Free and Equal Web
🧭 1. The Vision

The web was meant to be open, equal, and discoverable — a place where ideas rise because of value, not because of budget.
Fair Discovery exists to restore that balance.

It is a free, decentralized system that ranks web pages based purely on human engagement — not ads, manipulation, or corporate bias.
Every site is given an equal chance to be seen, discovered, and celebrated by the people who visit it.

🤝 2. The Principles
1. Freedom

Participation is free. Forever.
No one can be charged, restricted, or discriminated against for joining or hosting a Fair Discovery node.

2. Transparency

All algorithms, files, and logic are open-source and visible.
Every calculation, ranking, and discovery path can be audited by anyone.

3. Decentralization

No central authority.
Each website hosts its own /fair-discovery/discovery.json.
Each aggregator reads from many sources to form a distributed, community-driven web index.

4. Equality

No domain or brand receives special treatment.
Engagement data is measured purely by interaction — not by name, fame, or funding.

5. Privacy

No personal data is collected.
Engagement is measured anonymously and ethically — respecting visitors’ privacy and consent.

6. Sustainability

The network runs on open web standards — HTML, JSON, and JavaScript — without requiring expensive servers or external APIs.

7. Neutrality

Fair Discovery does not rank by politics, language, or geography.
It rewards connection, not content bias.

💡 3. The Method

Each participating site hosts a small /fair-discovery folder containing:

A discovery.json feed of engagement data

A transparent script that records interaction (scrolls, clicks, and time)

A dashboard to visualize engagement

Aggregators — hosted anywhere, by anyone — simply read these public feeds, merge them, and show a global leaderboard of engagement.

No crawling. No secrets.
Just open cooperation between honest websites.

🌱 4. The Promise

Fair Discovery will:

Never introduce monetization

Never sell or prioritize data

Never restrict participation

It belongs to the web — not to one company, country, or individual.
It is a commons — like the open ocean of knowledge.

🛠 5. The Invitation

Anyone can:

Host their own Fair Discovery node

Build their own aggregator

Improve the algorithms

Share or remix the code

Translate the manifesto

Together, we can create a search revolution — not by controlling discovery, but by liberating it.

⚖️ 6. The License

License: MIT Open License

You may copy, modify, distribute, and host this project freely — as long as you preserve this manifesto and its promise of freedom.

Fair Discovery will always remain free, open, and fair.
Because discovery belongs to everyone.

✍️ Founder’s Note

Created by Jarrith Hosking
 — in the belief that fairness on the web should never be a luxury, but a right.

“The goal isn’t to build another algorithm that decides what’s worthy.
The goal is to give the web back its power to decide for itself.”

— Jarrith Hosking, Founder of Fair Discovery
