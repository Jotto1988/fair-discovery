🌍 Why It’s Different (and Stronger Than SEO)
Traditional SEO	Fair Discovery Approach
Optimizes for algorithms (keywords, backlinks, metadata)	Optimizes for people (real user engagement)
Controlled by large search engines	Controlled by you and your users
Expensive to scale	Free and self-hosted
Ranking is opaque	Engagement data is transparent (open JSON)
Can be gamed by bots or link farms	Harder to fake — only real user interaction increases score
⚙️ How It Can “Push Your Site Ahead”

Human Validation Layer
Search engines increasingly rank based on “user signals” — bounce rate, dwell time, click depth, etc.
Your Fair Discovery data mimics that behavior and can be published openly.
→ If you share this JSON publicly (or let other sites reference it), it becomes a trust signal — a proof-of-engagement dataset.

Open Web Signals
You can make your site’s /fair-discovery/discovery.json accessible for aggregation (a community-driven “engagement index”).
That means you’re no longer waiting for Google’s crawlers — your site starts contributing to an independent discoverability network.

Organic Sharing Multiplier
High engagement correlates with real usefulness — the more people stay and interact, the more likely they’ll share your content.
The system amplifies pages that truly engage people (the opposite of keyword-stuffing).

Fairness by Design
Every site running this system has the same base algorithm:

score = time_spent + (interactions × weight)


No hidden bias, no paid boost.
It’s like an open competition for attention where quality wins.
